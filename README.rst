stackutil
=========

Stackutil is a collection of utilities to clean up after OpenStack when
something falls over.

The current ("Essex") release of OpenStack occasionally fails in a way such
that some data ends up "stuck" in the database.  For example: instances
stuck in the ``BUILD`` state, volumes stuck in the ``attaching`` state, and
so forth.

Stackutil provides utilities to list and purge entries from the database
that would otherwise require manual manipulation.

**WARNING**: These tools directly manipulate the underlying database
tables without regards to the normal OpenStack API.  They will very likely
break your OpenStack environment.  These tools are meant primarily to help
digging yourself out of hole when you're in the early stages of playing
with OpenStack.

Available subcommands
---------------------

- ``volumes`` -- list (or delete) volumes that are not ``in-use`` or ``available``.
- ``instances`` -- list (or delete) instances that are not ``active`` or ``deleted``.
- ``ips`` -- list (or free) ips that have allocated=0 but a non-null
  ``instance_id``.
- ``services`` -- list (or delete) disabled services.

Example usage
-------------

To list ips that have not been correctly de-allocated::

  # stackutil ips
  +-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
  | id    | address     | allocated | instance id |
  +-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
  | 16673 | 10.243.28.7 |         0 | 2246        |
  +-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+

To deallocate those ips::

  # stackutils ips --purge
  cleared address 10.243.28.7 (id 16673).
  +-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
  | id    | address     | allocated | instance id |
  +-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
  | 16673 | 10.243.28.7 |         0 | 2246        |
  +-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
